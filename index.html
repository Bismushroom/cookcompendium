            In the past recent years we have seen big changes across many different parts of the world for example that climate change is altering the lives of the entire worldâ€™s population. Due to climate change not only it is getting warmer but also different resources are available at later or earlier times of the year such as the growing of plants and agriculture which shifts due to increasing temperatures. Regarding human activity the global shipping and freight patterns also change which leads to this transformation of resource availability. This is why we need to adjust our lives to these alterations also in a nutritional regard. This is where we took the chance to create and design a cookbook that can be used as a guide for some healthy and nutritional recipes which are adjusted to the global sustainability goals leading us to contribute for a better environment and to mitigate excess waste and resources. We have created this compendium to inspire people for young students as well as other people to make a positive impact on our world by trying our recipes that were created by us and to receive different insights into the culture of healthy food that cannot be different from each itself. We wish you lots of fun and joy whilst trying out our recipes!
